# Risk

This is a port of the famous board game of the same name (Hasbro). The project consists of a GUI and backend, both coded exlusively in Python in collaboration with members of the project group. Some code has been edited for clarity but no additional work has been done since the project due date (3/26/14).

Final project for **CMSC 106: Introduction to Data Structures** -- An introduction to the fundamental data structures of computer science: strings, lists, stacks, queues, trees, BSTs, graphs, sets and their accompanying algorithms. Principles of algorithmic analysis and object reasoning and design will be introduced using mathematical techniques for the notions of both complexity and correctness. Some more practical issues, such as memory management and hashing, will also be covered. The programming language used to illustrate and implement these concepts will be Python, and emphasis will be placed on recursive thinking and its connection to iteration.

Completed March 2014
